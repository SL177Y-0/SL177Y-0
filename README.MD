## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer and Blockchain Architect focused on building AI and blockchain-powered ecosystems, 3D interactive web experiences, and LLM-integrated systems that enhance scalability and performance. My work emphasizes microservices-based architectures, AI reasoning integrated with decentralized logic, and building systems that are fast, intelligent, and future-proof.

## Recents

**PrimeX – AI & Blockchain Trading Protocol**  
PrismX is a production-grade decentralized finance trading platform engineered specifically for the Aptos blockchain ecosystem.The platform synthesizes critical DeFi primitives into a unified trading interface: leveraged perpetual futures via Merkle Trade, automated market making through Panora Exchange, liquid staking via Amnis Finance, and professional-grade wallet connectivity with persistent session management. Every architectural decision prioritizes security, performance, type safety, and developer experience.

**Quantum Node – Post-Quantum Blockchain Layer**  
Contributed to developing a quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure enhancing cryptography and consensus security.

**Aptos Contract Deployer – Backend Automation Layer**  
Developed a Dockerized backend microservice for seamless Move smart contract compilation and deployment via REST APIs, simplifying developer workflows.

**Agentic-AI – Decentralized AI Protocol**  
Built AI-governed vault systems and reward-driven social scoring integrating EVM and Aptos chains with AI-powered logic for dynamic on-chain reputation.

**3D Interactive Portfolio**  
Designed a WebGL-powered portfolio with lazy-loaded 3D models, skill cards, and physics-based animations, achieving 70% performance optimization through model batching and deferred rendering.

**CodeXero – No-Code DApp Generator**  
Enhanced WebContainer performance (-40% crash rate) and memory usage (-30%) while integrating Ethers.js, RainbowKit, and Supabase for fast and reliable dApp generation.
